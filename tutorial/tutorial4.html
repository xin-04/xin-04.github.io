            Where was their mother? She walked into the house. The children ran over to her. "Mama, we're so <font face="Blackadder ITC" size="6"><b><i>hungry</i></b></font>,"

            the soup into a pot</u>. She added water. She put the pot on the store. She made two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
            She sliced an apple. The soup was <font face="Blackadder ITC" size="6"><b><i>hot.</i></b></font>
